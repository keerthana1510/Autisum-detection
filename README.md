Autism Detection Using MobileNetV2

Overview

This project uses MobileNetV2 for autism detection through deep learning. The model is trained on image data and classifies images into two categories: autistic and non-autistic.

Features

Uses MobileNetV2 as a pre-trained base model.

Data augmentation applied to improve generalization.

Binary classification model with sigmoid activation.

Fine-tuning applied for better accuracy.

Evaluation on test dataset to measure model performance.


Challenges

Data scarcity: Limited labeled datasets.

Overfitting: Handled with data augmentation and fine-tuning.

Class imbalance: Addressed using balanced training batches.

Results

The model achieves high accuracy with fine-tuning.

Performance is measured using test loss and accuracy.
